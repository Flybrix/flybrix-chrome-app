#Flybric Configuration Utility

This Chrome extension lets you communicate with your Flybrix flightboard over USB. You can download the source code here or install from the Google Play Store by visiting http://flybrix.com/chrome.

Note that if you are trying to install from source, you must first update the libraries using bower. (From scratch, install node, npm install bower, and then bower update)

If you run into problems, send us a note!
