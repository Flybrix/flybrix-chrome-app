#flybrix - chrome app

Flybrix is still in alpha and our configurator is not yet avaiable in the Google Play Store. In the meantime, you can install it this way:

1. Download this repository.
2. In Chrome, select "more tools/ extenstions" from the "three bars" drop down menu at top right. Then check the "developer mode" box. 
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the configurator folder.
4. The Configurator extension should be added to you list. 
5. Click "Launch" to run the plugin.

If you run into problems, send us a note!
